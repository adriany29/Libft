# Libft
This project is about coding a C library.
The first part is about redoing a set of functions from the libc. The functions have the same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals. They comply with the way they are defined in their man. The only difference is their names.
The second part is developing a set of functions that are either not in the libc, or that are part of it but in a different form.
